# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

This website was refactored to make it more accessible. 


### User Story

As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibilty standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

### Acceptance Criteria

It meets the following accessibility standards that this challenge required:
-   The source code has semantic HTML elements
    - The div elements are non-semantic elements
    - Semantic elements used are aside, figure, footer, header, main, nav, and section
-   The HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
-   Images have accessible alt attributes
-   The heading attributes fall in sequential order
-   The title element is concise and descriptive (Horiseon)
